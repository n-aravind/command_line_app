# command_line_app

Create a new project in IntelliJ with a Main class with a main method

Run the main method and then edit the run configuration to add arguments

In a for loop print out the arguments

If an argument is "exit" then break out of the for loop which will end the program because there is no code after the for loop.

If an argument is "skip" then skip the rest of the code in the loop and continue to the top of the loop.

If the argument is "echo" then print "echo" twice.

Arguments used : Rams Saints skip echo Chiefs exit Patriots
